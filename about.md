Welcome! I'm a health economist, currently with Anthem, Inc's member management analytics. Here I plan on maintaing a small blog, mostly about topics in my professional sphere: health policy and economics, and statsitics and statistical computing.

You may wonder why the Twitter handle on this site links to someone who is definiteily not me (full disclosure-I'm not affiliated with any group/individual who I link to unless stated otherwise). The answer is pretty simple: I don't have a Twitter or Facebook account, but I also don't want to give up this great website real estate (kidding...), so I like to link to Twitter accounts of groups I support. If it means a little more attention to these groups, then great!
