##Introduction
This is the first post in what I'll start calling the "Health Economics The R Way" series, in which I'll provide tutorials on how to do common health economics tasks using R.

This post covers an introduction to using the `heemod` R package to do markov modeling, with an emphasis on applications to health economics (specifically an evaluation of healthcare technologies).


##Markov modeling in a nutshell
Very simply put

```{r installing}
#Install if you need: to check if you have the package installed you could
#run: "heemod" %in% rownames(installed.packages())
library(heemod)


```
