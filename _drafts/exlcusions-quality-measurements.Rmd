This issue came up at work today, and I thhought it was worth covering in short. 

Quality measurement is ubiquitous in healthcare today. 

Need to talk about specificity/sensitivity tradeoff and note that often when we are excluding a member we are giving too much benefit to providers. Talk about example of HEDIS measure for LBP and exclusions for HIV. In practice, this 'protects' providers from being dinged.
